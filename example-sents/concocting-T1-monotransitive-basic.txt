The ayatollah-dictator and the Revolutionary Guards have tried their best to discredit their opponents by concocting , through forced confessions at show trials , a conspiracy of regime change based on a `` velvet revolution '' produced by `` Western social sciences . ''
Judging from their recent statements , the scenario that they are concocting is simple .
Both the Bolsheviks and their opponents were involved in these falsifications , concealing , distorting , and concocting facts and circumstances , whether they referred to the real role of Stalin or Trotsky in the revolution or to the behavior of peasants and Cossacks .
