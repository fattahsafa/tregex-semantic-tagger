A gold medal signified the sporting abilities and dedication of individual athletes , not the supposed merits of the political system that produced them .
Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 , 1989 , signified the Cold War 's end , al-Qaeda 's attack on the United States opened a new epoch .
The meaning was clear to all : Weimar Russia , like Weimar Germany , signified a weak republic attacked from within by nationalists yearning to restore authoritarian ways .
