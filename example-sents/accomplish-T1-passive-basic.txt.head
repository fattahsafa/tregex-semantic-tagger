Assad compared the situations in Lebanon and Iraq , insisting that Iraq could achieve what Lebanon had already accomplished two decades before , namely the forced withdrawal by American and British troops in the face of steadfast , bloody resistance .
Europe must be more than a vehicle of economic integration , which is almost accomplished anyway .
Preemption by Gazprom has been accomplished through a raft of acquisitions .
In one stroke , Putin has jeopardized his considerable accomplishments .
Ukraine needs early parliamentary elections , but that is constitutionally difficult to accomplish .
Nobody has ever accomplished this , but ITER may be able to try around 2030 -- that is , if it solves the previous problem .
In a few short weeks , the Libyan opposition has been able to win the support of the population in the east without accomplishing much more than forming a provisional political body .
The hardest challenge will be for economies mired in oligarchic capitalism to accomplish a similar transition .
Bush 's New Middle East President George W. Bush 's declaration of `` mission accomplished '' in Iraq five years ago was as hubristic as his current assessment that the `` surge '' has `` delivered a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror '' is a fantasy .
History 's judgment of the Iraq war will therefore certainly dwell more on whether it has accomplished its strategic objectives of `` reconstructing '' a highly dysfunctional Middle East in America 's democratic image and consolidating America 's hegemonic position in the region than on its price in blood and money .
