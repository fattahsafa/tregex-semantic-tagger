But central banks today are influencing asset prices through a very large number of channels and procedures other than conventional open-market operations : they are trying to affect not just duration discounts but risk , default , and information-driven discounts as well .
Price discounts have been more effective , though their effect is limited by their focus on specific high-profile diseases and least developed countries -LRB- LDCs -RRB- .
But , given falling demand for gas , Russia had already begun renegotiating contracts in Europe and giving customers discounts .
Part of the blame also lies with bad market timing . Many Europeans bought into the US stock market at its peak in 1999 and 2000 , only to find themselves selling at steep discounts after the collapse of 2001 .
In essence , this is a back-door debt restructuring : Europe 's bailout fund , the European Financial Stability Facility -LRB- EFSF -RRB- would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts , thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default .
